# PW-Entry
A small program for entering passwords in forms where copy & paste does not work.
The password is sent with simulated keystrokes.
Thus, passwords can be transferred to windows that can only be accessed manually.
The password can be entered either via the input field, or via a list.

I'm not not a coder so the code is a bit messed up.
